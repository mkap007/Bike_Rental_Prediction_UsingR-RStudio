This was so fun to work with different packages and ploting. 
Actually I didn't find this mail in my inbox. I found it in mai Junk box. I did it in 6 hrs. I got too less time to do it relaxly. Anyway, I completed it.
For this prediction model I used three different modelling technique to compare which one fits the most (Like: Random Forest, Decision Tree & Linear Regression model).

Thank You for checking my script. Let me know about my work.

I Didn't have that much to run it on Jupyter Notebook for complete report or a pdf maybe.  I could Save and upload all the plots also. But sorry that I found it Today Only.
